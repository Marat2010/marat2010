                                        <pre>/task или "T" - просмотр задач и их дедлайн</pre>

                                    Смысл бота заключался не в большом кол-ве команд, а в организации авторизации
                                    не с помощью вебхуков, а по протоколу OAuth2. Что позволяло заходить в битрикс
                                    не под одним общим пользователем, а под своим.<br>
